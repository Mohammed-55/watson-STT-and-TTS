In this project, I made the Watson text to speech and Watson speech to text code by using the python programming language  and the tasks that I must do:

1. Use python language in IBM Watson to convert speech to text and text to speech.
2. Save the output text from (speech to text) as .txt file.
3. Save the output speech from (text to speech) as .mp3 file.

Here I will write the user manual to show how to use this code:

1. You can start it by opening the project file in the coder (like visual studio coder).
2. Then you have to open the terminal and write "python transcribe.py -t 5" to start the speech to text code (where the number here is equal to how many seconds it will record).
3. After that the code will record you speech as a text and in the end it will save your last sentance in outputss.txt file.
4. Then if you write "python text_to_speech.py" in the tirminal it will start the text to speech code here it will take the outputss.txt file that you made and it will read it as audio to the user.
5. At the end it will save the audio in tts.mp3 file.
